A frontend editor for WordPress. Free and open source project with a goal to enhance usability and convenience of editing content.

== Description ==
> The core concept with Fronted is that theme and plugin developers incorporate their configuration filter and/or add-on in their plugin or theme. However since version 1.3.5, it will automatically configure itself to make `post_content`, `post_title` and `post_thumbnail` editable if no other options are set.
